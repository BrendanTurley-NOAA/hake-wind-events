The output is in a NetCDF format easily read in R with NCDF4 library (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncdf4/index.html). Another easy way to quickly view NetCDF files is to download Panolpy from NASA (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/).

The data/model output used to create these indices and that is already subetted for the time and location can be accessed on an open googledrive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BEpNug49WR_O0Qzx7OHmBw4mbK2rLKPp?usp=sharing).

The original data/model output is the NOAA NCEP CFSR (available: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/climate-forecast-system-version2-cfsv2 or https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/). More details can be found in the published journal article (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333021926_Influence_of_wind_events_on_larval_fish_mortality_rates_in_the_Southern_California_Current_Ecosystem also: DOI: 10.1139/cjfas-2018-0458).
